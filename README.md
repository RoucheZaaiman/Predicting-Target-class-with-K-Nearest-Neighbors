# Predicting-Target-class-with-K-Nearest-Neighbors

Built a robust K-Nearest Neighbors predictive model using Scikit-learn to predict the target class in anonymised classification data.  I calculated errors for different k-values and identified an optimal k-value that resulted in the best model performance.

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
